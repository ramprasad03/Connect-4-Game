# Connect-4-Game
The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens. It is therefore a type of M,n,k-game (7, 6, 4) with restricted piece placement. Connect Four is a solved game

**Define the Environment**: Create the game environment for Connect 4, which includes the game board, rules, and actions that the agent can take.

**Design the Agent**: Choose an RL algorithm or framework like Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), or more advanced methods like AlphaZero. Design the agent's neural network architecture if you're using deep learning.

**Define Rewards**: Define a reward structure that guides the agent's learning process. In Connect 4, the agent should receive positive rewards for winning, negative rewards for losing, and possibly small rewards for making strategic moves.

**Data Collection**: Generate training data by having the agent play against itself or other opponents. This will help create a dataset for training and evaluating the agent.

**Training**: Train the RL agent using the collected data. Depending on the RL algorithm, this could involve iterations of playing games, updating the policy or value functions, and adjusting the agent's strategy.

**Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the agent's hyperparameters, neural network architecture, and training process to improve its performance.

**Evaluation**: Evaluate the agent's performance using various metrics like win rate against different opponents, average game length, and strategic gameplay.
