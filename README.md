# Reinforcement-Learning-for-connect-4-in-a-Line-Game-Bot-Training

The goal of this project is to develop a bot using Reinforcement Learning that can play Connect 4 against humans.

**Define the Environment**: Create the game environment for Connect 4, which includes the game board, rules, and actions that the agent can take.

**Design the Agent**: Choose an RL algorithm or framework like Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), or more advanced methods like AlphaZero. Design the agent's neural network architecture if you're using deep learning.

**Data Collection**: Generate training data by having the agent play against itself or other opponents. This will help create a dataset for training and evaluating the agent.

**Training**: Train the RL agent using the collected data. Depending on the RL algorithm, this could involve iterations of playing games, updating the policy or value functions, and adjusting the agent's strategy.

**Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the agent's hyperparameters, neural network architecture, and training process to improve its performance.

**Evaluation**: Evaluate the agent's performance using various metrics like win rate against different opponents, average game length, and strategic gameplay.
